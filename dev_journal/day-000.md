# Day 000 - 08 April 2025
---
**Key Milestone/Celebration:** I've scaffolded this project and thus taken the first step!

## What I Did Today
---
- Created the most essential files: `requirements.txt`, `main.py`, `.gitignore`, `README.md`, and the `dev_journal/` directory.
- Added appropriate files to `.gitignore`.

## Key Decisions & Why
---
- Scaffolded this project using only Python, because I will be keeping this as a purely backend project as a way of minimizing the scope to what's most relevant.

## What I Learned or Reinforced
---
### What I Learned
- For real-time database updates, `Connection.commit()` should be called after every write operation.

### What I Reinforced
- Starting a Python project.
