# Day 001 - 11 April 2025
---
**Key Milestone/Celebration:** 

## What I Did Today
---
- Installed essential dependencies and added to `requirements.txt`.
- Scaffolded a FastAPI app.

## Key Decisions & Why
---
- Installed the `fastapi` package.
  - FastAPI is the most standard Python API solution, and it's what I'm accustomed to. Therefore, building around this library will make developing this project quicker and more straightforward.
- Installed the `uvicorn` package.
  - Uvicorn serves as a very standard solution for running production servers for APIs. It is well-supported, straightforward to use, and effective.
- Installed `numpy`, `transformers`, and `pytorch`.
  - These are some of the most common libraries in AI/ML work in Python. I specifically want to learn about them through this project because of how much I see them come up in many contexts.
- Installed `pdfplumber`.
  - This is an easy-to-use and effective tool for scanning PDFs.

## What I Learned or Reinforced
---
### What I Learned
- `uvicorn` is a very standard tool for running production servers for APIs.
- `pdfplumber` is a standard, go-to tool for scanning PDFs.

### What I Reinforced
- Reading documentation, installing dependencies, and working with `requirements.txt`.
